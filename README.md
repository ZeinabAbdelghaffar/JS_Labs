# Lab 3 Part 3
## Task 1: Objects
In this section, I have implemented a JavaScript object named `person` with diverse properties. The code exemplifies the application of 10 predefined methods for objects:
- **Object.keys():** Returns an array of object keys.
- **Object.values():** Returns an array of object values.
- **Object.entries():** Returns an array of key-value pairs as arrays.
- **Object.hasOwnProperty():** Checks if an object has a specified property.
- **Object.assign():** Copies the values of properties from source objects to a target object.
- **Object.freeze():** Prevents modification of the object.
- **Object.seal():** Prevents new properties from being added and removes existing properties.
- **Object.getOwnPropertyNames():** Returns an array of all properties found directly upon the object.
- **Object.getPrototypeOf():** Returns the prototype of the specified object.
- **Object.is():** Compares two values for equality.
## Task 2: Arrays
This section centers on JavaScript arrays labeled `numbers`. Here, I illustrate the application of 10 predefined methods for arrays:
- **Array.length:** Returns the number of elements in the array.
- **Array.concat():** Joins two or more arrays, returning a new array.
- **Array.push():** Adds elements to the end of the array.
- **Array.pop():** Removes the last element from the array.
- **Array.shift():** Removes the first element from the array.
- **Array.unshift():** Adds elements to the beginning of the array.
- **Array.slice():** Returns a shallow copy of a portion of the array.
- **Array.splice():** Changes the contents of the array by adding, removing, or replacing elements.
- **Array.indexOf():** Returns the first index at which a given element can be found.
- **Array.includes():** Determines whether an array includes a certain element.
## Task 3: Closures
In this task, I've crafted a nested function showcasing the concept of closures and lexical environments. The `outerFunction` contains an `innerFunction`, and the closure is invoked with specific parameter values.
# Apple and Orange Landing Problem
## Problem Description
Sam's house is located between an apple tree and an orange tree. Both trees yield an abundance of fruit, and the task is to determine how many apples and oranges will land on Sam's house.
The house is represented by a range on the x-axis, denoted by the start point `s` and the endpoint `t`. The apple tree is at point `a` (to the left of the house), and the orange tree is at point `b` (to the right of the house). When a fruit falls from its tree, it lands `d` units of distance from its tree of origin along the x-axis. A negative value of `d` means the fruit fell `d` units to the tree's left, and a positive value means it falls `d` units to the tree's right.
Given the values of `s`, `t`, `a`, `b`, and the distances at which each apple and orange falls from their respective trees, the task is to determine the number of apples and oranges that land on Sam's house.
## Input
The input consists of the following parameters:
- `s`: Starting point of Sam's house location.
- `t`: Ending location of Sam's house location.
- `a`: Location of the Apple tree.
- `b`: Location of the Orange tree.
- `apples`: Distances at which each apple falls from the Apple tree.
- `oranges`: Distances at which each orange falls from the Orange tree.
## Output
Print two integers on two different lines:
1. The number of apples that fall on Sam's house.
2. The number of oranges that fall on Sam's house.

# Lab 4: Person Class Implementation
This implementation involves creating a `Person` class with specific attributes and methods using four different programming paradigms.
## 1. Using Constructor Functions:
A constructor function is a way to create and initialize objects. In this paradigm, a `PersonConstructor` function is defined, which takes parameters for `fullName`, `money`, `sleepMood`, and `healthRate`. When invoked with the `new` keyword, it creates an instance of the person object.
## 2. Using Classes:
Classes are a modern way to create objects in JavaScript. The `PersonClass` class is defined with a constructor that initializes the same attributes. This provides a more structured and syntactically cleaner way to create objects.
## 3. Using Objects Linking to Other Objects (OLOO):
Object Linking to Other Objects (OLOO) is a paradigm that focuses on creating objects and linking them to others. In this case, the `PersonOLOO` object is defined, acting as a prototype. The `createPerson` method creates new person objects linked to this prototype, providing a way to share behavior.
## 4. Using Factory Functions:
A factory function is a function that returns objects. The `createPersonFactory` function is defined to create a person object directly. It takes parameters and returns an object with the specified attributes.
## Person Methods:
All implementations share the same methods for the `Person` object:
### - Sleep Method:
The `sleep` method takes the number of hours slept as a parameter and adjusts the `sleepMood` attribute based on the hours slept. If the hours are 7, the person is "happy"; if less than 7, the person is "tired"; if more than 7, the person is "lazy."
### - Eat Method:
The `eat` method takes the number of meals as a parameter and adjusts the `healthRate` attribute based on the number of meals. If 3 meals, health rate is set to 100; if 2 meals, health rate is set to 75; if 1 meal, health rate is set to 50.
### - Buy Method:
The `buy` method takes the number of items to buy as a parameter and decreases the `money` attribute by 10 LE (local currency) for each item bought.

# Lab 6 :
This JavaScript project is a multi-part exploration of object-oriented programming, involving the creation of classes to model geometric shapes. The project is divided into three main parts:
## Part 1: Shape Class
The initial task involves defining a `Shape` class with properties such as `name`, `sides`, and `sideLength`. The class is designed to model shapes with equal-length sides, like squares or equilateral triangles. The objectives include adding a constructor to initialize the properties, implementing a method (`calcPerimeter`) to calculate the perimeter, and testing the class with instances like a square and a triangle.
## Part 2: Square Class
Building upon the `Shape` class, the second part introduces a `Square` class that inherits from `Shape`. The `Square` class includes a method (`calcArea`) to calculate the area of the square. The constructor of the `Square` class is configured to automatically set the name property to "square" and the sides property to 4. The section concludes with an example instantiation of the `Square` class and calls to its methods for testing.
## Part 3: Triple Class and SquaredTriple Subclass
The final part introduces a new class called `Triple`, which includes static fields (`customName` and `description`) and a static method (`calculate`). Additionally, a subclass called `SquaredTriple` is created, inheriting from `Triple`. The `SquaredTriple` class overrides the static method to return the square of the triple of a given number. Example tests are provided to demonstrate the functionality of both the `Triple` and `SquaredTriple` classes.
The project serves as a practical exercise in object-oriented programming concepts, including class inheritance, static fields, and methods. The provided code snippets can be used as a foundation for further exploration and application of these principles in JavaScript development.
