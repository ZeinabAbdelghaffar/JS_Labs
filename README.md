# Lab 1
## Task 1: 
1. Ask the user to enter his first name.
2. Ask the user to enter his last name.
3. Confirm the full name.
4. Ask the user to enter his birth year.
5. Welcome the user using his full name and age.
   Example: Welcome Zeinab Abdo, you are 22 years old.
## Task 2:
1. Show a message to tell the user that it's the first release of a calculator that only has a summation feature.
2. Ask the user to enter the first number.
3. Ask the user to enter the second number.
4. Show the summation result.
   Example: 10 + 5 = 315

# Lab 2
## Task 1:
Ask the user to enter their age. Validate the input (accept positive numbers only). Display the user's status based on the following age ranges:
- Child: 1-10 years old
- Teenager: 11-18 years old
- Grown-up: 19-50 years old
- Old: 50 years and above
Keep prompting the user to enter another age until they click cancel.
## Task 2:
Ask the user to enter a string. Count the number of vowels (a, e, o, u, i) in that string.
## Task 3:
Write a JavaScript program to convert the 24-hour clock to a 12-hour clock, adding "AM" or "PM" based on its value. Examples:
- 0 -> 12AM
- 11 -> 11AM
- 13 -> 1PM

# Lab 3 Part 1:
## Task 1: Login
Create a JavaScript script to be run in a web browser.
1. User will enter their Username and Password.
2. If the username is "admin" and the password is "421$$", display the message: "Welcome, login success."
3. If incorrect username or password is entered, provide feedback on which data was entered incorrectly.
## Task 2: Calculator
Create a JavaScript script to be run in a web browser.
1. User will enter the first number.
2. Enter an operation (sum, multiply, subtract, divide, modulus).
3. Enter the second number.
4. Perform the operation and show the result to the user.
### Bonus:
- Using the concepts from Lab 2, add the following features:
  - User can use the last result to perform a new operation.
  - For example, user enters 1, then sum, then 3, then shows 4, then sum, then 5, then shows 9, and so on.
  - Utilize loop statements for repeating the process.

# Lab 3 Part 2:
## Task 1: Calculate the Sum and Average
- Ask the user to enter how many numbers they want to get the sum of.
- Save the numbers in an array.
- Calculate and show the sum and average of the entered values.
## Task 2: Phone Book App
- Ask the user for the operation through JS prompt.
  - If the user enters "add":
    - Ask for the name and phone number.
    - Create a JavaScript object for that contact and add it to the contacts array.
    - Ask for a new operation and repeat.
  - If the user enters "search":
    - Ask for something to search for.
    - Search in the contacts array by name and phone.
    - Show the user the full details of the contact.
    - Ask for a new operation and repeat.
## Bonus: Area Calculator
- Ask the user to enter the name of the shape for which they want to calculate the area.
- Ask for the dimensions of that shape.
- Calculate the area and show it to the user.
### Shapes and Equations
1. **Circle**: \( \pi \times r^2 \) (where \( r \) is the radius of the circle)
2. **Triangle**: \( \frac{1}{2} \times b \times h \) (where \( b \) is the base and \( h \) is the height)
3. **Square**: \( a^2 \) (where \( a \) is the length of the side)
4. **Rectangle**: \( l \times w \) (where \( l \) is the length and \( w \) is the width)
5. **Parallelogram**: \( b \times h \) (where \( b \) is the base and \( h \) is the vertical height)
6. **Trapezium**: \( \frac{1}{2}(a + b) \times h \) (where \( a \) and \( b \) are the lengths of parallel sides and \( h \) is the height)
7. **Ellipse**: \( \pi \times a \times b \) (where \( a \) is half of the minor axis and \( b \) is half of the major axis)
